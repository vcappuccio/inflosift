- **Advanced Metadata Extraction**: Automatically extracts and indexes file metadata and timestamps
- **Natural Language Query Support**: Powered by Ollama for intuitive data exploration
- **Focused Analysis**: Specialized in critical areas such as DHCP failover issues
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily adaptable for custom log formats and analyses
- **Support Bundle Flattener**: Includes a tool to decompress and organize support bundle contents

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- SQLite3
- Pandas
- Ollama client
- Colorama (for colored console output)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vcappuccio/inflosift.git
   cd inflosift
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure Ollama is installed and running on your system.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

InfloSift offers two main components:

### 1. Support Bundle Flattener

Decompress and organize your support bundle:

```bash
python support_bundle_flattener.py <source_directory> <destination_directory>
```

### 2. Log Analyzer

Analyze the flattened support bundle:

```bash
python inflosift.py [--directory DIRECTORY] [--query QUERY] [--focus FOCUS]
```

Options:
- `--directory`: Specify the support bundle directory (default: current working directory)
- `--query`: Provide a natural language query for analysis
- `--focus`: Specify the focus area for the query (e.g., "DHCP failover")

### Examples:

1. Flatten a support bundle:
   ```bash
   python support_bundle_flattener.py /path/to/support_bundle /path/to/flattened_bundle
   ```

2. Process flattened support bundle files:
   ```bash
   python inflosift.py --directory /path/to/flattened_bundle
   ```

3. Query for DHCP failover issues:
   ```bash
   python inflosift.py --query "Identify critical DHCP failover events in the last 24 hours" --focus "DHCP failover"
   ```

## üìä Database Schema

InfloSift creates a SQLite database with the following structure:

| Table          | Description                               |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| files          | File metadata and content hashes          |
| lines          | Individual lines from text files          |
| ptop_data      | Process data from ptop files              |
| smaps_data     | Memory mapping data                       |
| syslog         | Standard syslog entries                   |
| support_syslog | Support-specific syslog entries           |
| infoblox       | Infoblox-specific log entries             |

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization and Extension

InfloSift is designed with extensibility in mind. You can easily:

- Add support for new log formats
- Implement custom analysis queries
- Extend the database schema for additional data points

Refer to our [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details on how to extend InfloSift.

## üîç Troubleshooting

- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed
- Verify that Ollama is running and accessible
- Check file permissions for the support bundle and destination directories
